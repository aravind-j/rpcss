	abstract = {The principal aims of a core collection are: 1) to include the maximum of diversity of the base collection in a sample of minimum size; and 2) to avoid redundancies. We present here a new method (the Principal Component Scoring) which fulfills these aims. The use of P.C.S. has consequences for sampling stratification and choice of sample size. P.C.S. requires quantitative data, but with small changes can be used for qualitative data.},
